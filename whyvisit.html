        <h1>So, why visit?</h1>
        <p>
        There are many reasons to visit Istanbul, but these are the top 5:
        <p>
        1. Hagia Sophia - Hagia Sophia, an iconic and monumental structure in Istanbul, is a beautiful and historically significant place to visit. 
        Commissioned by Emperor Justinian I in the 6th century, it blends Roman engineering with Byzantine aesthetics and features splendid architecture, 
        elaborate mosaics, and a rich history. It used to be a church, and when the Ottomans conquered Constantinople, it soon after became a mosque.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        2. Galata Tower - Galata Tower, or Galata Kulesi in Turkish, is a medieval stone tower located in Istanbul, Turkey. It was built in the 14th century by the Genoese 
        colony as part of the defense wall surrounding their district at Galata directly opposite ancient Constantinopolis. The tower is approximately 67 
        meters long and was the tallest building in Istanbul when it was built. It has served different purposes over the years, including as a watchtower, 
        prison, and fire lookout. Today, it is an exhibition space and museum, and a symbol of Beyoğlu and Istanbul.
        </p>

        <p>
        3. Blue Mosque - The Blue Mosque, officially known as the Sultan Ahmed Mosque, is an Ottoman-era historical imperial mosque located in Istanbul, Turkey. 
        It was constructed between 1609 and 1617 during the rule of Ahmed I and remains a functioning mosque today. The mosque is renowned for its distinctive blue 
        tiles, six minarets, and Ottoman architecture. It was commissioned by Sultan Ahmet I and is situated near the Hagia Sophia.
        </p>

        <p>
        4. Grand Bazaar - The Grand Bazaar is one of the oldest and largest covered markets in the world. It contains over 4,000 shops with about 26,000 employees. 
        With a history of more than five centuries, it remains a symbol of Istanbul’s cultural heritage.
        </p>

        <p>
        5. Emirgan Park - Emirgan Park is a historical urban park located in Istanbul, Turkey. It is situated on the European side of the city, with beautiful landscapes, 
        colorful flower gardens, and stunning views of the Bosphorus Strait. The park was opened to the public in 1943 and is now owned by the Metropolitan 
        Municipality of Istanbul.
