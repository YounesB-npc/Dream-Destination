        Istanbul: History
        </h1>
        <p>
            Istanbul, formerly known as Constantinople, was initially settled by Greek colonists as Byzantium in the 7th 
            century BCE. Roman Emperor Constantine the Great transformed it into his capital in 330 CE, renaming it 
            "New Rome" and later "Constantinople," serving as the center of the Byzantine Empire for over a thousand years. 
            In 1453, the Ottoman Empire conquered the city, making it the capital of their vast realm. 
            This marked a shift from Christian to Islamic dominance, with iconic landmarks like the Hagia Sophia transitioning 
            from a church to a mosque. Finally, in 1930, the city was officially renamed Istanbul, reflecting its Turkish identity.

            The Hagia Sophia was originally built as a basilica for the Greek Orthodox Christian Church. However, its function has changed several times in 
            the centuries since.
